**IBM i / AS400 Connector for Confluent Overview** 

The IBM i / AS400 was first introduced in 1988, and since then has evolved keeping pace with new concepts and technologies, it is a very stable and robust modern all-purpose system that surprisingly  requires little or no management. The system is able to run core line of business applications securely and predictably, focusing on quality of service and availability and offering a compelling total cost of ownership for integrated on-premises solutions. IBM made several changes to the server and OS name (iSeries, System i, IBM i, Power Systems for i) but most still refer to it as AS/400.
The IBM i platform offers several integration options including PHP, Java, WebSphere, specialized lightweight web service containers, FTP, SMTP / emails, DB2 interfaces, data queues, integrated file systems - IFS, as well as an abundance of products offered by IBM and Third-party vendors. The main benefit of using "native" options such as Program Calls and Data Queues is that IBM i development teams do not have to learn another language or purchase and support another technology in order to build the integration layer and can easily communicate with external systems using only traditional development tools.
The Program Call is the most straightforward and low code option for exposing IBM i business logic as a reusable asset. The IBM i connector enables direct program calls from Kafka applications, passing parameters into the program and receiving the results back in real time.
Data queues are native IBM i objects designed primarily for inter-process communications. They are lightweight persistent queues that support processing by a key and support order by FIFO or LIFO organization. The majority of integration use cases can be implemented with the pair of request and response Data Queues. The source system places a message to the request data queue and waits for an acknowledgement message to be placed on the response data queue. The target system receives and processes a message from the request data queue then places the acknowledgement to the response data queue.
The IBM i connector makes it easy to build Kafka code that talks to IBM i applications. Infoview Systems also developed the IBM i ‘Web Transaction Framework’ that makes it very fast and easy to develop IBM i code that communicates with Kafka.


**Prerequisites**

The connector is designed to work with IBM i objects (e.g. programs and data queues) and therefore this document assumes you are familiar with IBM i operational and development environments and tools.
This document assumes you are familiar with Confluent Kafka, Kafka Connect and Confluent Control Center and provides configuration examples and a detailed explanation of each and properties required to run the connector in Confluent Control Center.

**IBM i server configuration and requirements** 

-   IBM i must have ports 449, 8470, 8472,8473,8475 and 8476, 9470, 9472, 9473, 9475 and 9476 accessible from Kafka runtime

-   IBM i must have *CENTRAL, *DTAQ, *RMTCMD, *SIGNON and *SRVMAP host servers running in the QSYSWRK subsystem

-   If secure TLS connection is used, the TLS certificate must be applied to Central, Data Queue, 
    Remote Command, Sign on, and DDM / DRDA services in Digital Certificate Manager

-   IBM i user ID must be authorized to perform the operations on the intended IBM i objects

-   If there’s an additional security software that locks down the remote execution functionality,
    the IBM i user ID defined for connector configuration must be allowed to execute remote calls 
    and access database, IFS and DDM services

**Dependencies** 

-   Access to IBM i server

-   Access to Confluent Kafka  

**Compatibility Matrix**
| Application/Service     | Version       |
| ----------------------- |---------------|
| Confluent Kafka         |6.0.0 or higher|
| Confluent Control Center|6.0.0 or higher|
| IBM i / OS400           |V5R4 or higher |
             

**Connector Operations** 

The IBM i connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the 
connector to your Kafka connect cluster, you need to configure a specific operation the connector
is intended to perform. The connector supports the following operations:

| Operation                          | Version       |
| -----------------------------------|---------------|
| Read Data Queue (Message Source)   | Perpetually listen for new messages arriving to specific data queue.|
| Write to Data Queue                | Write messages to data queue.|
| Program Call                       | Execute IBM i program.       |
             
             
**Install the AS400 Connector** 

Connectors are packaged as Kafka Connect plugins. Kafka connect isolates each plugin so that the 
plugin libraries do not conflict with each other. Download and extract the ZIP file for 
your connector and then follow the below installation instructions.
-  **In Standalone mode**

    1.  kafka-connect-as400 connector can be downloaded directly from the confluent-hub using 
      	                       
              confluent-hub install confluentinc/kafka-connect-as400:1.0.0
              
    2.  Extract the content into the desired location (Preferred: /confluent/share/java or /confluent/share/confluent-hub-component)

    3.  Start confluent control center using command “confluent local services start”
    
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46368616/133743614-0642b415-96c1-49c2-9501-507388935129.png)
    
    4.  Control center should be up and running and can be verified with [http://localhost:9021](http://localhost:9021)
       
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46368616/133744830-27cd0bc2-4bf0-4f4c-8b97-c8f84a21bad8.png)
    
    5.  Source and Sink connectors are ready to configure now. And here are the sample configurations to be used.

-  **In Distributed mode**

    1.	kafka-connect-as400 connector can be downloaded directly from the confluent-hub using
	
              confluent-hub install confluentinc/kafka-connect-as400:1.0.0
                
    2.	Connector can be installed using the Confluent Hub or you can manually download the ZIP file.
	
    3.	Extract the content into the desired location 
	
              /usr/share/java,/home/apeksha/confluent-6.2.0/share/confluent-hub-components
                
    4.	Add downloaded zip file path to the plugin path in connect-distributed properties file. For example
	
              plugin.path=/usr/share/java, /home/apeksha/confluent-6.2.0/share/confluent-hub-components

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46368616/133746430-5a95aec4-4576-4efd-a09e-74ae1fd3fbaa.png)
      
    5.  Kafka connect finds the plugins using its plugin path. A plugin path is a comma-separated list of directories defined in the kafka connects worker configurations
    
    6.  Start the Connect workers using “confluent local services start”. Connect will discover all connectors defined for plugin.path
